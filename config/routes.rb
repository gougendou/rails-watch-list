Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # get 'lists/index'
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  # root "articles#index"

  resources :lists, only: %i(index show new create) do
    resources :bookmarks, only: [:create]
  end

end

# Features
# Once again, you must have a precise idea of the features of your app in order to build your routes. Here is the list of features:

# A user can see all the lists
# GET "lists"
# A user can see the details of a given list and its name
# GET "lists/42"
# A user can create a new list
# GET "lists/new"
# POST "lists"
